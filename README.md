# Dijkstra Algorithm
This script asks you to select a 'point of origin' and a 'goal' from a given list in the console. Once both values are selected, the script calculates the shortest distance between both nodes and then illstrates it using matplotlib.

I wrote this script mainly for practice purposes. Feel free to comment.
